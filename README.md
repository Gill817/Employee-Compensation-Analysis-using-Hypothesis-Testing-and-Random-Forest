Employee Salary Prediction

📘 Overview

This project predicts the salaries of U.S. government employees using machine learning and validates assumptions through statistical analysis. By applying hypothesis testing, feature engineering, and a Random Forest regression model, the project identifies key factors that influence salary levels such as experience, department, and position.

An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes trends, disparities, and predictive outcomes — helping stakeholders make sense of compensation structures within public sector agencies.


🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and predict salary patterns among U.S government employees by combining statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques. Through data-driven insights, the project aims to identify how factors such as department, job title, location, and experience influence employee compensation.
It also demonstrates end-to-end data analytics workflow — from cleaning raw datasets, validating hypotheses (t-test, ANOVA), and building predictive models (Random Forest) to visualizing results in Power BI dashboards for actionable insights.




🚀 Features

🧩 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removed missing values, standardized job titles, and encoded categorical variables.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered salary distribution patterns, outliers, and departmental trends using Python visualizations.

🔍 Hypothesis Testing: Applied statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA) to validate assumptions such as “Experience significantly impacts salary” and “Department affects pay distribution.”

🤖 Machine Learning Model: Built a Random Forest Regressor to predict employee salaries from structured datasets.

🧠 Feature Engineering: Derived features like experience level and job grade to enhance model precision.

📈 Power BI Dashboard: Created interactive visuals — actual vs predicted salary, top-paying departments, and salary trends by experience and position.
